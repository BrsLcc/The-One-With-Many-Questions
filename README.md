# The One with All the Questions

## Description

A small react quiz project. The main goal here was to practice working with components, state, state management, props...

The code will eventually be refactored as well each component should be separated in their own files.

## Live Version

[Live Version of the App](https://the-one-with-many-questions.netlify.app/)

## Features

The quiz has 100 questions, with the ability to restart the quiz, tracking the score as well as the high score from the local storage.

## Future updates

1. Adding a "smooth" transition when loading the quiz, pressing start and reset, and between each question.

2. Shuffling the questions array as well the answers so they don't appear in the same space

3. Adjusting/adding more breakpoints for media query

4. Document properly (explain how the code works not what it does...)
